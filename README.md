# MobX and Injectable

This is a small proof of concept for combining the MobX library and the injectable library. Between the two, we get nice dependency injection and state management with minimal boilerplate.

## Getting Started

Generate the build files by running the command listed below. By using `watch`, any updates will automatically be rebuilt. If you want to do it once, just use `build` instead of `watch`.

```shell script
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
